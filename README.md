# LIFT-SAFETY-MONITORING-SYSTEM
The Lift Safety Monitoring System is an innovative   project designed to enhance lift safety by ensuring quick detection and notification about individuals  trapped or struck inside the lift during power outages. 
The system operates by activating PIR motion sensors upon detecting a power outage. 
If motion is detected inside the lift, the system triggers the ESP32 module to send an alert message 
to a designated emergency contact, ensuring prompt action. Users can configure the emergency 
contact details within the system, which are stored and used to send notifications during 
emergencies. The project aims to decrease the risks associated with prolonged entrapment in lift, 
thereby improving safety standards in buildings. 
This system integrates multiple components such as a PIR motion sensor, 
an Arduino controller, a backup power supply, an ESP32 communication module, and an ACS712 
current detection sensor. The primary objective of this project is to detect the presence of a person 
inside the lift in case of a power failure and immediately send an alert message to a predefined 
emergency contact, enabling swift rescue operations. 
This project holds significant practical applications in residential and commercial buildings, offering a 
cost-effective and efficient safety solution. By addressing challenges such as power outages and 
delayed emergency responses, this system stands as a vital advancement in lift safety technology.
